			<h1> Lab5: Data Types and Variables </h1>
			<p> We are experimenting with JS data types and variables. </p>
			<h2> Challenges </h2>
			<p> Following the guide on the document was helpful. I have previous experience with cse20 and I am familiar with data types and variables. I had trouble linking the js, but with the help of my partner, we were able to figure  it out. This assignment had mimimal challenges, outside of time constraints; lots to do in a single week and not enough time. </p>
			<h2> Results </h2>
			<p> We are successful in completing the assignment!</p>
