						<h1> Lab5: Data Types and Variables </h1>
						<p> We are experimenting with JS data types and variables. </p>
						<h2> Challenges </h2>
						<p> Following the guide on the document was helpful. I have previous experience with cse20 and I am familiar with data types and variables. </p>
						<h2> Problems </h2> I had trouble linking the js, but with the help of my partner, we were able to figure  it out.</p>
						<h3> Results </h3>
