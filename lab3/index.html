	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures </h1>

	<p> The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my
		computer and add index.html files. </p>

	<h2> Challenges </h2>

	<p> I was okay creating the file stucture. I had to miss a couple days due to illness, but Im back. This class ismoving kind of fast/there is quite a bit to do now. I hope staying on track is easier moving forward. </p>

	<h3> Results </h3>

  	<p> Task 1: Here's a screenshot of our file structure in atom </p>

	<img id="file-structure" src="img/file-structure.jpeg" />

    <p> Task 2: HTML source code and screenshot of the site in browser </p>

	<img id="html-source" src="img/html-source.jpeg" />

		<p> Task 3: Take a screenshot of your html source code in Atom and a screenshot of
			art101/la b3/index.html as it appears in your browser. </p>
