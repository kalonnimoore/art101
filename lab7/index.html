		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		<p>Diamond and Gage, went over the documents and slides and learned to write functions that take user input. </p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> At first we thought we could simply follow the models in the assignment, but we had to do a lot of research to understand what we were doing and how to get our names to spell out correctly. We went over the logistics of how the names would be sorted for awhile because we were trying to ensure we understood the functions. It took a lot of time for no reason, lol. We had to go back and debug a few times too, but we figured it out!</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>We did it!! :</p>
