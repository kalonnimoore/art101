		<h2>About Me: </h2>
		<p>I am a 3rd year student. I am studying Film and Digital Media, and Art and Design: Games and Playable Media. I also want to major in Psych if I have the time. Right now, im super excited about using creative mediums to transform our future. I want to act and direct, with the goal of portraying possible futures for society(relistic and obtainable ones.) Anywho, I also have the coolest cat, Cru! Full name: Cru Kyd Moore. (Pics and UNECESSARY EXPLANATION: This guy was born around the same time as Cruella and he's a a tuxedo, so.. and he has crooked tail, so.. and well he is the mostest, but I named him Moore. Or he just took Mama's last name.) </p>
