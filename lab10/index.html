		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Diamond and Gage create a button! </p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> We had trouble getting our results to display clearly on our webpage with the background. We played with our css file for a while. At some point I, Diamond, has two boxes appear on webpage and I couldnt detect why or where I asked for two. I missed a semicolon somewhere; its wild how much that could do. </p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>We did it!! Emily is so Amazing <3</p>
